#JavaScript Hash Functions

Some JavaScript implementations of common hash functions (MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256) designed to be
compressed into the smallest size possible.

I can't entirely guarantee that they'll absolutely always work exactly as they should, so it's
probably not the best idea to use them in anything absolutely mission-critical. That said, they
do seem to work fine for me wherever I use them. And if you do find something wrong, open an issue
[on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/js-crypto/issues) and I'll do my best to fix it.

You don't have to explicitly credit me (but if you do then I won't complain), but just don't pass
them off as entirely your own, ok? That's just not cool.
